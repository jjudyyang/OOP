## Inheritance 
- creating new classes based on exisitng class
- derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class
- code reuse and creation of hierachies of related classes 

## Polymorphism 
- ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class
- allows you to write code that can work with mutiple different classes through shared interface 
- use virtual functions, which are overriden in derived classes to provide specialized implementations

# Object Oriented Programming

### About 
Personal repo for studying C++ Object Oriented Programming Concepts (cs246)

# Topics  

## Pre Midterm
- Input/Output
- File streams and string streams
- C++ String Operations 
- Default Function Parameters
- Function Overloading
- References (rvalues and l values)
- Pass by value and pass by reference
- Dynamic Memory
- Operator overloading

## C++/Intro to OOP
- Preprocessor directives (processed by the preprocessor before actual compilation - begin with the # symbol)
- Separate compilation and include guards?
- Classes
- Constructor
- Object Creation (MIL, implict conversion)

- Big 5
- Destructor
- Copy constructor
- copy assignment operator
- Copy/Move Elision
- Visibility (public & private), class keyword vs struct 
- Encapsulation
- Iterators (auto type, range based loops)

## Post Midterm

- Inheritance
- 3 Access Levels (public, private, protected)
- Dynamic Dispatch/Polymorphism 
- Virutal Methods vs Pure Virutal Methods 
- Abstract/Concrete Classes 
- Partial assignment/Mixed Assignment/Polymorphic Assignment

UML
- fields 
- has-a
- owns-a

Design Patterns
- observer pattern
- decorator pattern
- factory method pattern
- template method pattern
- iterator pattern 

Idioms
- RAII
- NVI
- pImpl (used in exception safety)
- copy and swap

Standard Template Library
- Vector and common vector functions
- Vector Iterator/Reverse Iterator 
- Map and common map functions 
- Iterate through map

Casting 
- static_cast
- dynamic_cast
- reinterpret_cast
- const_cast

VTables and virtual inheritance 

Exception Safety, throw, catch
- basic 
- strong
- no throw

Coupling, Cohesion

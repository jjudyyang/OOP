# Virtual Function
virtual function is a member function of base class which can be redefined by derived class
- not abstract 
- defination is given in base class 
- object can be instantiated 
- if derived class does not redefine function of base class, then it does NOT affect compilation


# Pure Virtual Function 
- class is abstract 
- only declaration is provided in base class, no defination
- object can not be instantiated
- SHOULD be defined in derived class ( otherwise derived class also becomes abstract)
- all derived class must redefine pure virutal functions

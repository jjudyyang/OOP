# Iterators
- provide standardized way to traverse and interact with elements within various data structures 

## Abstraction and Encapsulation
- hide the underlying data structure's traversal mechanisms
- user does not need to know implementation details 
- can change data structure internals without affecting the code that uses the iterator

## Boundaries 
- prevent accessing elements beyond containers boundaries
